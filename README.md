# Empirical Analysis for Crime Prediction and Forecasting using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques


The project utilized the Chicago dataset to address the issue of crime forecasting, which involves predicting crimes before they occur. Crime is a significant social problem impacting the quality of life and economic growth of societies. One of the current challenges is maintaining a proper dataset of crime and effectively analyzing this data to aid in predicting and solving future crimes.

In this project, four algorithms were employed: Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The main objective was to analyze a dataset containing numerous crime records and predict the type of crime that might occur in the future based on various conditions.

Among these algorithms, XGBoost was identified as particularly effective for crime prediction.
