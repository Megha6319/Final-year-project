# CRIME PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING of CHICAGO DATASET
-Chicago dataset is used.
-Crime Forecasting refers to the basic process of predicting crimes before they occur. 
-Crimes are a common social problem affecting the quality of life and the economic growth of a society. 
-The current problem faced are maintaining of proper dataset of crime and analyzing this data to help in predicting and solving crimes in future.
-There are four algorithms used namely 1. Logistic Regression 2.XGBoost Classifier 3.Decision Tree and 4.Multi Layer Pereptron.
-The main objective of this project is to analyze dataset which consist of numerous crimes and predicting the type of crime which might occur in future depending upon various conditions.
-After testing and training the Chicago dataset we  obtain the accuracy as follows:                         
     1.XG Boost-92%
     2.Decision Tree-89%
     3.Logistic Regression-87%
     4.MultiLayer Perceptron[MLP]-86%
-XG Boost gives the best accuracy rate with 92%.
